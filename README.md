# ECAD_tick_2*
A maze game created for the second optional tick of ECAD labs.

The code runs on Cambridge FPGA board, with support of CLARVI for running c codes.

The code of maze generation is due to Joe Wingbermuehle.

You can find a link to a demonstration video on youtube here:

# Special features:

  Paths that the player has walked would be coloured in red, so technically you can colour the entire map just for fun.
  
  There is a hex displayer at the backside of the FPGA board(not recorded in the video), and the random seed is displayed there.
  
  The random seed changes as the rotary moves, so player will have a different maze as long as he/she moved the rotary, which is a very natural thing to do.
  
  In fact, all players I've shown didn't notice this before I hinted out.
